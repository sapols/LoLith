 - Information

 - Hub

•	Description: The central idea of our project is to create a website that will augment gameplay of the popular online battle game “League of Legends.” More specifically, our website will scrape data from the game’s API and display meaningful, novel player information including win/loss percentages of players users have played with.

•	Vision statement:  “Relevant and reliable League of Legends stats.”

•	Motivation: Our leading motivation for working on this project is to provide the League of Legends community with gameplay statistics not available on currently existing websites. Even though players seem to play isolated, many games seem to promote team oriented game play as well as playing with your friends and/or creating new friendships. Our website would display an individual's statistics when they play with a friends versus with a random teammates. Other benefits include learning to develop using an API and learning the basics of website development.

•	Risks:
- Continuing to work on the project during busy weeks
- Developing in unfamiliar languages (JSON, Javascript, HTML, etc.)
- Attempting new/unfamiliar ideas (e.g. Website development) 
- Unforeseen complexities of game API
-	Limited in-person team communication 

•	Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risks:
-	Setting small goals so that even on busy weeks team members can make some progress
-	Communicating so that we can get used to each other’s coding styles and keep each other accountable
-	Also communication helps keep ideas in line with one another
-	Communication method: In person and Slack
-	Designating an organizer so that the project has clear direction and deadlines are met
-	Ensuring each team member is accountable for the task he/she commits to
-	Using online tutorials for unknown languages and API
